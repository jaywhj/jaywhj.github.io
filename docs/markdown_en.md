## What is Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight text-only markup language that uses a simple handful of symbols to mark up text, resulting in print-quality formatting with minimal typing effort. It strikes a balance between smooth writing and a print-quality reading experience, allowing you to focus on the content rather than the layout.

Commonly used markup symbols no more than ten, so it's easy to remember and easy to use.
